**1. Business Need**
The bank required a comprehensive solution to monitor and analyze loan-related metrics to optimize its lending operations. Key challenges included:

Tracking Loan Applications: Understanding trends in loan applications over time (Month-to-Date, Month-over-Month).
Monitoring Loan Metrics: Assessing the total funded amount, repayment performance, and interest rate variations.
Evaluating Borrower Profiles: Identifying patterns in borrower behavior, such as debt-to-income (DTI) ratios, loan purposes, and employment history.
Loan Quality Analysis: Differentiating between "Good Loans" and "Bad Loans" to mitigate risks and improve profitability.


**2. Solution Using Business Analytics Techniques**
The problem was solved by designing an Excel Dashboard that utilized data analytics and visualization techniques, including:

**Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
Imported raw data into Excel and cleaned it using filters and formulas to ensure consistency and accuracy.
Added calculated fields like Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) metrics using formulas such as SUMIF, AVERAGEIF, and INDEX-MATCH.

**Descriptive Analysis:**
Created pivot tables to summarize key metrics like Total Loan Applications, Funded Amount, and Amount Received.
Segmented data to analyze "Good Loans" vs. "Bad Loans" using conditional formatting and custom filters.

**Data Visualization:**
Designed charts, including line graphs for monthly trends, bar charts for loan purposes, and tree maps for home ownership analysis.
Created KPI cards to display critical metrics at a glance.

**Loan Status Grid View:**
Developed a detailed grid view categorizing loan statuses and displaying performance indicators such as Average DTI and Interest Rate.

**3. Conclusion and Business Impact**
The Excel dashboard provided a clear and actionable overview of the bank's loan portfolio. Key benefits included:

**Improved Decision-Making:** The detailed grid and visualizations empowered stakeholders to identify high-risk loans and improve borrower selection criteria.
**Enhanced Monitoring:** Month-over-Month and Month-to-Date tracking facilitated timely interventions to address emerging trends.
**Increased Efficiency:** Automation of calculations and visual reporting saved time, allowing the bank to focus on strategic initiatives.
**Risk Mitigation:** Differentiating between "Good Loans" and "Bad Loans" helped refine lending policies, leading to better profitability and lower default rates.
